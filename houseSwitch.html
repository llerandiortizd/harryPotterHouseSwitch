			<p>Gryffindor students possessed characteristics such as courage, chivalry, nerve and determination. The Gryffindor house emphasised these traits as well as daring and chivalry, and thus its members were generally regarded as brave, though sometimes to the point of recklessness. 
			Some Gryffindors had also been noted to be short-tempered.</p>

			<p>Hufflepuff were known to be hard-working, friendly, loyal, honest and rather impartial. It might be that due to their values, Hufflepuffs were not as competitive as the other houses, and were more modest about their accomplishments. 
			Hufflepuff was the most inclusive among the four houses; valuing hard work, dedication, patience, loyalty, and fair play rather than a particular aptitude in its students.
			Hufflepuffs were known to have a strong moral code, and a sense of right and wrong. Hufflepuffs were usually accepting of everyone. Students in Hufflepuff were known to value everyone and treat them as equal.</p>

		<div id="ravenDiv" class="houses hidden">
			
			<p>Ravenclaw House prized learning, wisdom, wit, and intellect in its members. Thus, many Ravenclaws tended to be academically motivated and talented students. They also prided themselves on being original in their ideas, and methods. It was not unusual to find Ravenclaw students practising especially different types of magic that other houses might shun.
			Often hard-working and diligent, as often was the case with intellectuals with a predisposition for academics, some of the pupils sorted under the blue-bronzed eagle were known to be inclined to dismiss certain social expectations for the sake of satisfying their own intellectual curiosity. 
			Some of these eventually also ended up being not only accepted but even celebrated, in spite of being initially subjected to scorn for their various oddities. </p>

		<div id="slytherDiv" class="houses hidden">
				
			<p>Slytherins tended to be ambitious, shrewd, cunning, strong leaders, and achievement-oriented. They also had highly developed senses of self-preservation. This means that Slytherins tended to hesitate before acting, so as to weigh all possible outcomes before deciding exactly what should be done.
			Slytherins tended to take charge and possessed strong leadership skills. They were often self-assured and confident of their own competence and can be very loyal.</p>
